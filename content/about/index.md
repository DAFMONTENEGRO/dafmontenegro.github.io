Well, let's just say I'm your friendly neighborhood **software engineer.**

I'm not exactly a Spider-Man fan; however, **I love his catchphrase** and I have a special affection for **the Spider-Verse movies**.

To do the character justice (**and for having borrowed his catchphrase**), I'm going to point out one of those moments where **you learn to love Spider-Man**:

Everything is an **ephemeral moment**, but that is what makes it beautiful and worthy of ***being appreciated***.
