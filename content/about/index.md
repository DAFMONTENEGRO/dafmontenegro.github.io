Well, let's just say I'm your friendly neighborhood **software engineer.**

I'm not exactly a Spider-Man fan; however, **I love his catchphrase** and I have a special affection for **the Spider-Verse movies**.

To do the character justice (**and for having borrowed his catchphrase**), I'm going to point out one of those moments where **you learn to love Spider-Man**:

> ...But I handled it like a champion. 'Cause you know what? No matter how many times I get hit, I always get back up.

## About Me
My name is **Daniel Felipe Montenegro.**

By day, I'm a passionate **software developer** who loves to dive into code with the purpose of building solutions that impact people's everyday lives. By night? I’m exploring **cinema**, **music**, **literature** and a little bit of **poetry**; sometimes all at once, because all those things remind me that **I’m alive.**

This site is a bit more than just a **personal diary** open to the world; it’s really a way to connect with you. Here, I share my **professional work, ideas, and thoughts.** Every now and then, a feeling slips out, but that’s part of the **creative process**... I’m always open to collaborating on initiatives that generate **positive change** for everyone, so stick around; there's always **something exciting happening.**

If you want to know something more about me, you should know that the **most important** thing for me in life **is my family** and never give up **being yourself**; always be honest to your core. I faithfully believe that **I must have the courage and strength** to fight for a safe world for the people I love, and for no one else to feel the pain that I once felt or was felt by the **people who came before me.**

Everything is an **ephemeral moment**, but that is what makes it beautiful and worthy of ***being appreciated***. Nothing is as **trivial** as it seems and when **we realize** all the things that had to **fall into place** to make this instant **possible**; we can live with **fascination** this beautiful experience ***that is life.***

## Caesar's window
Caesar's window is a hypocycloid that he draws while locked in captivity to **remember his home**. Later, the other apes will remember this symbol as a representation of Caesar and *his essence*.

Caesar from the Planet of the Apes trilogy is **my favorite fictional character**, and one with which I feel deeply identified. If I must confess, at this moment in my life, I feel like Caesar when he talks to Maurice and tells him, ***“Apes Together Strong”***, after joining several pieces of branches to demonstrate that **they are stronger together than alone**. I firmly believe in collaboration and teamwork; sometimes it seems that we can go faster alone, but I am sure that **together we can always go further**.

![Caesar in War for the Planet of the Apes](img/caesar-ape.jpg "Caesar in War for the Planet of the Apes")

For these reasons, I decided to make Caesar's symbol **my personal symbol** as well, because I believe in others as much as I believe in myself, and because **I dream to be a great leader one day**. I prepare myself every day with all my efforts to be worthy of that dream and many others that I carry **in my heart**.
