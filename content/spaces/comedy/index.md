## South Park

![Butters Stotch](img/butters.png "Butters Stotch")

South Park is undoubtedly my favorite comedy show, far above others like **Rick and Morty** or even The **Simpsons**. What I value most about South Park is its **sharp satire** and **social critique**. In a single episode, the series has the ability to offer multiple perspectives while being **brutally incisive** about the contradictions that permeate our society. It does not merely question the behaviors or customs of individuals, groups, or institutions; rather, **it exposes the flaws and absurdities that we often overlook.**

Many episodes of South Park are **simply entertainin**g, but others invite reflection on one or several topics, thus generating change or, at the very least, raising **necessary awareness**.

My collection is in Spanish because I love the Latin dubbed version.

> Rudy Ray Moore: [Speaking with the Bihari Brothers about them helping finance the production of "Dolemite" by giving up future royalties to his records] I'm going to bet on myself. Ain't nobody going to put me on the screen except for me, and everybody I talk to say they want to see a "Dolemite" movie.
>
> Julius Bihari: Well, we understand. You're not supposed to make a movie for the five square blocks of people you know.
>
> Rudy Ray Moore: [takes pause] Well... that's fine with me. 'Cause every city in America got those same five blocks. And those folks is going to love it!
