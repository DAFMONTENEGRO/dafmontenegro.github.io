I want to start with something that ***Jack Conrad says in Babylon*** about what cinema is; something that, for me, **embodies** its *true essence*: something **beautiful** and **magical**... something **full of meaning**.

> It's not a low art, you know. I want you to know that. What I do means something to millions of people. My folks didn't have the money or the education to go to the theater, so they went to the vaudeville houses, and then the nickelodeons. And you know what? There's beauty there. What happens up on that screen means something. Maybe not to you in your ivory tower. But for real people on the ground, it means something.

Sometimes, cinema was that refuge to escape reality for a few hours. It was a moment to gather in the darkness and appreciate something ***together***, so that, over time, **we valued the company of that person more than any film**. Whether it was good or bad, there was always **a smile and a conversation** on the way home. Cinema is a place full of meanings where, **no matter who we are or where we come from**, we can be the same person sitting in front of the screen, letting ourselves be fascinated and *hoping to be surprised*.

**As Jack** in the cinema I have found beauty in things and the memories I have of cinema, always **evoke my family and special moments**; because the cinema is the magical place I have always gone to with the **people I love**.
