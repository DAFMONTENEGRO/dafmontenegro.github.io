Well, let's just say I'm your friendly neighborhood **software engineer.**

## About Me
My name is **Daniel Felipe Montenegro.**

By day, I'm a passionate **software developer** who loves to dive into code with the purpose of building solutions that impact people's everyday lives. By night? I’m exploring **cinema**, **music**, **literature**, and a little bit of **poetry**; sometimes all at once, because all those things remind me that **I’m alive.**

This site is a bit more than just a **personal diary** open to the world; it’s really a way to connect with you. Here, I share my **professional work, ideas, and thoughts.** Every now and then, a feeling slips out, but that’s part of the **creative process**... I’m always open to collaborating on initiatives that generate **positive change** for everyone, so stick around; there's always **something exciting happening.**
