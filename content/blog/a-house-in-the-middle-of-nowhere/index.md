When we were together, I remember we had a house in the middle of nowhere.
In that place, it was always **you and me**... Somewhere far from sadness and pain, we camouflaged ourselves, hiding secretly from the world, and sharing the darkness was just **one of our many acts of love**.

Moving there was our protest against the world, but it wasnâ€™t about hiding from it; it was about finding in each other what had been denied to us alone. Over time, **what started as a house became a home**. It was no longer just a refuge, a den, or an oasis; it was something simpler, **but ours**... We used to say our love was like a fire, because in that darkness that isolated us, that light was what kept us under the same roof.

*You were my family and my love; I still live in that house even though **you no longer live here**.*

This prose poem was originally written in **Spanish** and recited **by me** in a video about **Shutter Island**. You can watch it on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MiAmigoMelquiades).
